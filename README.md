# CI Dashboard Visualization

## Overview

By aggregating data from various CI/CD tools, it allows users to track the progress of builds, view test outcomes, and understand deployment statuses at a glance.

## Features
- **Real-Time Updates:** Automatically fetch and display the latest build statuses from integrated CI tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, and Travis CI.
- **Custom Dashboards:** Users can create personalized dashboards focusing on specific projects or teams.
- **Visualization Widgets:** Display data in various formats such as graphs, tables, and charts for better clarity.
- **Notification System:** Integration for alerts on build failures or test failures via email or messaging apps like Slack.
- **User Management:** Role-based access control to ensure that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized personnel.
